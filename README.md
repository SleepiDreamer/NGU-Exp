# NGU-Exp
This is an NGU IDLE Exp optimiser so you don't have to do any maths! 

this is for energy ONLY! 
numbers with decimals will create infinitely long numbers for some reason, but it's still "correct" (except the 0.00000000001 difference it might have) 

what it will ask: 

stats: 
"power?" type your power 
"cap?" same as above BUT, if your cap is 100000 (100k), write 100, without the last 3 zeros 
"bars?" same as power 
ratio: (the 1/37.5/1 thing) 
"power to cap ratio?" if you want to follow that ratio, write one. else, write your own (first number from the ratio you follow) 
"cap ratio?" again, if you follow the ratio from before again, type 37.5. else, type your own 
"bars to cap ratio?" same as power to cap ratio, but for bars 

now the program will figure out in what EXP upgrades you will have to invest, and how much EXP you will need. 

if you find any bugs, please dm me on discord! (bliksemremi #5390)
